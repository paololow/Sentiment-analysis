# Sentiment-analysis
				
In this project I wanted to implement a text classification algorithm, in particular regarding an application in sentiment analysis. In
sentiment analysis we want to predict the emotional state of the writers of text messages. It is a classification problem, where the classes
are the authors’ emotions (angry, delighted, sad, happy, disgusted. . . ). It can be used as a cost-effective way of measuring the opinion of
people by processing their comments about products, books, tv shows, political parties, etc.

We will analyze movie reviews written by the users of the IMDB website (www.imdb.com (http://www.imdb.com)). We will try to predict the
polarity of the reviews distinguishing the positive comments from the negative ones.
				
I used the data set that has been introduced in the paper: “Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis,” by Andrew L. Maas et al. It
includes 50000 reviews equally divided among the two classes. The data set is already divided in a training set of 25000 reviews, a
validation set of 12500 and a test set of 12500.
